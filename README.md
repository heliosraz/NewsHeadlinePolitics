Political Spectrum of News Headlines<br />
Authors: Max Gilli, William Walker, Sunny Zhou<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of this project was to write a neural network that can predict the political preferences of the author based on their headline. In the current political climate, it is confusing where news articles stand on issues and what political aisle they are on. The finished project was supposed to allow individuals to input a headline and receive a rating from -2 to +2 ( -2 being far left, 0 being center, and +2 being far right).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To collect the headlines data we will be using, archives from news websites themselves (such as “CNN Site Map”). We ended up scraping 6 sites (1 for ratings -2, 0, 1, and 2, and 2 for rating -1) Some sites that will be used to gather training data included, Fox News, Washington Post, CNN, BBC, and The New York Times. In the data folder you will find the web scraping scripts and data files ussed to do this. We used the python module Beautiful Soup and Requests to do this <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To convert texts into something our models/algorithims can work with, we will have to vectorize the texts based on a dictionary. Instead of using the entire dictionary for the english language, it was more cost effective to create the dictionary based on what the words occur in headlines. Using term frequency–inverse document frequency, chosen headlines were vectorized by whether they contain certain dictionary words, and placed as rows of a matrix X. Meanwhile, for each row i of X there will be a yi in a matrix Y to classify the headline. An attempt was made for a function to be able to vectorize any headline to use for the model. Any new words put into this function was suppose to discarded.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Future implications of the model include being used to explore how certain words/phrases vary between political views and how political veiw points can shift over time. This is why in the raw_data csv's we have a column for the date.<br />
